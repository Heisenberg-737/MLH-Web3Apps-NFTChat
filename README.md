NFTChat is developing an AI-driven chatbot that makes the users aware of web3 and blockchain, mint NFTs on 14 different chains or upload data to IPFS storage through a simplified chat interface in a few quick steps and utilizes natural language processing and cutting-edge technologies like OpenAI and ChatGPT-4.

## Functioning and Workflow ü•Ω

- NFTChat is an AI-driven blockchain chatbot using Voiceflow that simplifies the process of minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and storing images on IPFS.
- Through the utilization of Voiceflow, Verbwire, web3.Storage, OpenAI's GPT4 and Stable Diffusion APIs, NFTChat guides users step-by-step throughout the minting process.
- Users are required to provide necessary details such as name, description, wallet address, and image URL. Alternatively, they can use Generative AI to mint an NFT using Stable Diffusion.
- Once all information is provided, NFTChat proceeds to mint the NFT and provide relevant details such as transaction hash and ID. It also offers URLs for users to view their NFT on Block Explorers and OpenSea. NFTChat is compatible with 14 blockchain networks and eliminates the need for users to navigate complex blockchain systems or switch between platforms.
- Users can also use groundbreaking GPT4 to know more about Blockchain and have their queries cleared.
- By leveraging AI-driven chatbots and cutting-edge APIs, NFTChat ensures that minting NFTs becomes easy and accessible for everyone involved.

## Goal ‚öΩÔ∏è

The goal is to eliminate the barriers that have traditionally hindered crypto's growth and adoption, thereby making it more accessible to a broader range of people while ensuring privacy and security.

## Inspiration üîî

The team at EzyNFT shares a common enthusiasm for blockchain technology and its transformative potential in the field of finance. Their objective is to streamline the process of engaging with cryptocurrencies, making it accessible to individuals from all walks of life. Additionally, they firmly believe in the power of chatbots and natural language processing to simplify intricate tasks associated with cryptocurrencies.

## Why NFTChat? ü§®

At this moment with the growing crypto industry, and the fast-paced development of the Web3 ecosystem, we believe it is absolutely essential to simplify the process of important transactions in order to support higher user engagement and participation. 

*A balance needs to be struck between the public perception and understanding of Web3 and the actual processes and trades in the crypto market!*

An AI-powered chatbot that can perform these highly convoluted trading tasks with a few, quick natural language sentences, can help bring in more users and more money.

## Challenges üåßÔ∏è

- Integrating Metamask with Voiceflow was a significant hurdle due to the inability to run asynchronous functions together. However, after reaching out to Voiceflow customer service, they found an alternative solution by incorporating Verbwire.
- Another challenge was developing the NFT minting feature, which involved extensive communication between users and the bot. Despite these obstacles, they successfully created a functional and user-friendly feature.
- Integrating Voiceflow chat with Hedera's API was a significant challenge. Hedera isn't supported on Verbwire, so we had to make separate 3-4 API calls to make minting an NFT on Hedera happen.

## Project Outcome and Learning üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

- The team gained a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology and became proficient in utilizing various blockchain services.
- They also acquired valuable skills in natural language processing and AI technology, specifically through integrating OpenAI ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion into their platform.
